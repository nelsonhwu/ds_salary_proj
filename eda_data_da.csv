About Us
Presbyterian Healthcare Services is a locally owned, not-for-profit healthcare system of nine hospitals, a statewide health plan and a growing multi-specialty medical group. Founded in New Mexico in 1908, it is the state's largest private employer with approximately 11,000 employees.
Presbyterian's story is really the story of the remarkable people who have chosen to work here. Starting with Reverend Cooper who began our journey in 1908, the hard work of thousands of physicians, employees, board members, and other volunteers brought Presbyterian from a tiny tuberculosis sanatorium to a statewide healthcare system, serving more than 700,000 New Mexicans.

We are part of New Mexico's history - and committed to its future. That is why we will continue to work just as hard and care just as deeply to serve New Mexico for years to come.

About New Mexico
New Mexico's unique blend of Spanish, Mexican and Native American influences contribute to a culturally rich lifestyle. Add in Albuquerque's International Balloon Fiesta, Los Alamos' nuclear scientists, Roswell's visitors from outer space, and Santa Fe's artists, and you get an eclectic mix of people, places and experiences that make this state great.

Cities in New Mexico are continually ranked among the nation's best places to work and live by Forbes magazine, Kiplinger's Personal Finance, and other corporate and government relocation managers like Worldwide ERC.

New Mexico offers endless recreational opportunities to explore, and enjoy an active lifestyle. Venture off the beaten path, challenge your body in the elements, or open yourself up to the expansive sky. From hiking, golfing and biking to skiing, snowboarding and boating, it's all available among our beautiful wonders of the west.

By offering unlimited downloads and continually adding fresh content, Storyblocks challenges the paradigm that your ambitious creative vision requires deep pockets. Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, Storyblocks has been recognized by the Inc 5000 list seven consecutive years and was recently named as one of Washington D.C.'s Top Workplaces by The Washington Post, and among the Best Places to Work by the Washington Business Journal.

COVID-19 Update:

Storyblocks has adjusted to the COVID-19 pandemic by creating a flexible, work-from-home environment. All employees are free to work from wherever they like through at least April 2021 (or later depending on vaccine rollouts).

Who You Are:

We're looking for a data analyst to help us deliver business intelligence and insights to every function of the organization! The right candidate will have deep analytical and visualization expertise with experience performing both quick data pulls and deep-dive analyses. If you're excited by the opportunity to get exposure to multiple problem spaces filled with challenging and interesting questions to solve with data, this is a role for you!

What You'll Do:

Thought Partnership

Storyblocks structures its teams using a modified squad (i.e. multi-functional team) model in which our analysts form partnerships with squad leads. As an analyst, that means you will:
work with your squad lead to ask and answer important questions that drive value for our business by improving our understanding of our customers and product
set up reporting to measure your squad's performance while also using your expertise to inform which metrics to track
use data to identify and own high-value problem spaces within your squad's purview
work with your squad lead to drive iterative development, creating experiments to test hypotheses, analyzing the results, and building on the knowledge gained
estimate impact to inform prioritization decisions and tradeoffs
Core Analytics

At Storyblocks, you'll use your analytical prowess to its fullest extent. That means you will:
develop and maintain data-driven reporting and dashboards
extract, clean, transform, and visualize data to inform business decisions
break down and solve difficult problems with data
use both databases and distributed computing technologies to manipulate data
perform statistical analyses to determine significance and help stakeholders make decisions
What You Bring to the Table:
0 - 2 years of hands-on analytics experience manipulating large, complex data sets
Expertise in data manipulation, ideally using at least one of SQL, Python, or R
Experience with data visualization or dashboarding
Experience with executive-level reporting a plus
Ability to make tradeoffs between effort and return, automating tasks when appropriate
Strong analytical and critical thinking skills
Comfort breaking down and attacking open ended problems
Familiarity with A/B Testing and statistical techniques a plus
Team player that can collaborate and communicate with people across all levels and functions
What We Bring to the Table:
Competitive and fair compensation: We believe in fair pay--equal pay for equal work. For each title, we have consistently applied competitive salary bands based on market data and benchmarks. What you've been paid before, fear of conflict, or willingness to negotiate does not play a part.
Company-paid medical: Our medical, dental and vision premiums are covered 100% for you and your dependents.
Paid parental leave: Welcoming new family members is exciting, but it can also be challenging. We offer twelve weeks paid leave for primary caregivers and four weeks for secondary caregivers. We have a dedicated private nursing room available to new mothers.
Unlimited vacation: At Storyblocks we take vacation seriously. That means take the time off when you need it. Don't worry about tracking hours or accounting for partial days. Typically employees take about three or four weeks each year.
Flexible work-from-home options: Much of our workflow is online, and for meetings, we have dedicated video-conferencing setups. As long as you deliver results, you are welcome to get your work done outside of the office or during unusual times when desired.
Company-sponsored mentorship and growth: We have a formal mentorship program that involves regular career and growth conversations. ""360-degree"" feedback is collected twice a year and synthesized into actionable, peer-reviewed, performance reviews. We happily foot the bill for conferences and online courses that will add value to the organization. We encourage attending meetups and are happy to host them as well.
Casual Work Environment: Sure we all get dressed up once in a while, but in general we want you to be comfortable at the office – whatever that means to you (flip-flops, shorts, jeans, etc.).
Fully stocked kitchen: Everyone gets input on the food and drinks we stock in our shared refrigerators and snack room. We have multiple mechanisms for making coffee and cold-brew kegs are often on tap.
Dogs in the office: We love dogs and we will probably love your dog too. With help from a calendar, we allow employees to bring in their dogs to help guide us through the day.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Contractor will compare on a Feeder by Feeder basis (i) the vendor photo and the assets identified within the photo to (ii) the assets identified with the NG Smallworld GIS system and (iii) the assets located on the NG regional control center index maps. The contractor will identify any discrepancies between these three components and either (a) update the NG Smallworld GIS system where appropriate or (b) recommend changes to the NG Smallworld GIS and Index Maps for correction by other NG departments. All updates, recommended changes or questions to external groups shall be entered by the Contractor within the NG IMAP ARCGIS Online environment. Contractor will confirm the photo quality and verify that the photo assigned to a NG GIS Asset ID is consistent with the asset information within NG Smallworld GIS. Discrepancies will require that the Outside Vendor for Photo Acquisition be notified to enable them to correct the photos.
Contractor execute a series of checks which validate the connectivity of the feeder. Contractor will update the NG Smallworld GIS system as appropriate to correct any validation errors.
Contractor (separate from the contractor who performs the virtual walk down and validation phases) will perform a quality control / quality assurance step on the feeder, ensuring that the proposed modifications are accurate based on the QAQC Status assigned to the Virtual Walk Down person. Corrections to the feeder will be sent back to the person assigned the Virtual Walk Down / Validation steps for corrections. Contractor will prepare and send to the NG Maps & Records Sharepoint site (i) all Index Map changes and (ii) complex changes.
QAQC Contractor resource will close out a feeder by posting the Smallworld GIS modifications within the NG Smallworld GIS system when a feeder has been determined to be clean of any issues / discrepancies. The QAQC Contractor will notify the National Grid DP&I department that a feeder is closed, enabling the DP&I department to continuously monitor that feeder for any modifications in the future.
Manager notes:
- Project's original scope is through March 2021.
- Location: Syracuse NY
- Open to candidates who need to relocate (please indicate this at the top of the resume).
There should not be any additional charge to National Grid for the candidate to relocate.
- Electric distribution experience/knowledge is requested, but not required.
- GIS experience - not a necessity but it does help with the process of using the tools
- When the contractor is reviewing the asset on the poles and comparing it's very helpful
to have knowledge of electrical distribution
-BA degree or equivalent experience
-MA degree is overqualified
- Independent worker is valuable
*More electric distribution experience requested as compared to ARCGIS experience. We can teach the ARCGIS experience, but the electric experience is valuable when a virtual walk down of the electricity distribution system occurs to confirm the connectivity model. The connectivity model is a simple way of indicating that all of the components on the electric distribution system align.*

All updates, recommended changes or questions to external groups shall be entered by the Contractor within the NG IMAP ARCGIS Online environment. Contractor will confirm the photo quality and verify that the photo assigned to a NG GIS Asset ID is consistent with the asset information within NG Smallworld GIS. Discrepancies will require that the Outside Vendor for Photo Acquisition be notified to enable them to correct the photos.
Contractor execute a series of checks which validate the connectivity of the feeder. Contractor will update the NG Smallworld GIS system as appropriate to correct any validation errors.
Contractor (separate from the contractor who performs the virtual walk down and validation phases) will perform a quality control / quality assurance step on the feeder, ensuring that the proposed modifications are accurate based on the QAQC Status assigned to the Virtual Walk Down person.

- Project's original scope is through March 2021.
- Location: Syracuse NY
- Open to candidates who need to relocate (please indicate this at the top of the resume).

-MA degree is overqualified
- Independent worker is valuable
*More electric distribution experience requested as compared to ARCGIS experience. We can teach the ARCGIS experience, but the electric experience is valuable when a virtual walk down of the electricity distribution system occurs to confirm the connectivity model. The connectivity model is a simple way of indicating that all of the components on the electric distribution system align.*

2nd Modification: Key Tasks, Add the following bulleted items to more accurately detail what would be expected of a contractor performing work on either the NY / NE Data Enhancement Project:
Contractor will compare on a Feeder by Feeder basis (i) the vendor photo and the assets identified within the photo to (ii) the assets identified with the NG Smallworld GIS system and (iii) the assets located on the NG regional control center index maps. The contractor will identify any discrepancies between these three components and either (a) update the NG Smallworld GIS system where appropriate or (b) recommend changes to the NG Smallworld GIS and Index Maps for correction by other NG departments. All updates, recommended changes or questions to external groups shall be entered by the Contractor within the NG IMAP ARCGIS Online environment. Contractor will confirm the photo quality and verify that the photo assigned to a NG GIS Asset ID is consistent with the asset information within NG Smallworld GIS. Discrepancies will require that the Outside Vendor for Photo Acquisition be notified to enable them to correct the photos.
Contractor execute a series of checks which validate the connectivity of the feeder. Contractor will update the NG Smallworld GIS system as appropriate to correct any validation errors.
Contractor (separate from the contractor who performs the virtual walk down and validation phases) will perform a quality control / quality assurance step on the feeder, ensuring that the proposed modifications are accurate based on the QAQC Status assigned to the Virtual Walk Down person. Corrections to the feeder will be sent back to the person assigned the Virtual Walk Down / Validation steps for corrections. Contractor will prepare and send to the NG Maps & Records Sharepoint site (i) all Index Map changes and (ii) complex changes.
QAQC Contractor resource will close out a feeder by posting the Smallworld GIS modifications within the NG Smallworld GIS system when a feeder has been determined to be clean of any issues / discrepancies. The QAQC Contractor will notify the National Grid DP&I department that a feeder is closed, enabling the DP&I department to continuously monitor that feeder for any modifications in the future.
Manager notes:
- Project's original scope is through March 2021.
- Location: Syracuse NY
- Open to candidates who need to relocate (please indicate this at the top of the resume).
There should not be any additional charge to National Grid for the candidate to relocate.
- Electric distribution experience/knowledge is requested, but not required.
- GIS experience - not a necessity but it does help with the process of using the tools
- When the contractor is reviewing the asset on the poles and comparing it's very helpful
to have knowledge of electrical distribution
-BA degree or equivalent experience
-MA degree is overqualified
- Independent worker is valuable
*More electric distribution experience requested as compared to ARCGIS experience. We can teach the ARCGIS experience, but the electric experience is valuable when a virtual walk down of the electricity distribution system occurs to confirm the connectivity model. The connectivity model is a simple way of indicating that all of the components on the electric distribution system align.*

We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Contractor will compare on a Feeder by Feeder basis (i) the vendor photo and the assets identified within the photo to (ii) the assets identified with the NG Smallworld GIS system and (iii) the assets located on the NG regional control center index maps. The contractor will identify any discrepancies between these three components and either (a) update the NG Smallworld GIS system where appropriate or (b) recommend changes to the NG Smallworld GIS and Index Maps for correction by other NG departments. All updates, recommended changes or questions to external groups shall be entered by the Contractor within the NG IMAP ARCGIS Online environment. Contractor will confirm the photo quality and verify that the photo assigned to a NG GIS Asset ID is consistent with the asset information within NG Smallworld GIS. Discrepancies will require that the Outside Vendor for Photo Acquisition be notified to enable them to correct the photos.
Contractor execute a series of checks which validate the connectivity of the feeder. Contractor will update the NG Smallworld GIS system as appropriate to correct any validation errors.
Contractor (separate from the contractor who performs the virtual walk down and validation phases) will perform a quality control / quality assurance step on the feeder, ensuring that the proposed modifications are accurate based on the QAQC Status assigned to the Virtual Walk Down person. Corrections to the feeder will be sent back to the person assigned the Virtual Walk Down / Validation steps for corrections. Contractor will prepare and send to the NG Maps & Records Sharepoint site (i) all Index Map changes and (ii) complex changes.
QAQC Contractor resource will close out a feeder by posting the Smallworld GIS modifications within the NG Smallworld GIS system when a feeder has been determined to be clean of any issues / discrepancies.

Manager notes:
- Project's original scope is through March 2021.
- Location: Syracuse NY
- Open to candidates who need to relocate (please indicate this at the top of the resume).
There should not be any additional charge to National Grid for the candidate to relocate.
- Electric distribution experience/knowledge is requested, but not required.
- GIS experience - not a necessity but it does help with the process of using the tools
- When the contractor is reviewing the asset on the poles and comparing it's very helpful
to have knowledge of electrical distribution
-BA degree or equivalent experience
-MA degree is overqualified
- Independent worker is valuable
*More electric distribution experience requested as compared to ARCGIS experience. We can teach the ARCGIS experience, but the electric experience is valuable when a virtual walk down of the electricity distribution system occurs to confirm the connectivity model. The connectivity model is a simple way of indicating that all of the components on the electric distribution system align.*

And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Contractor will compare on a Feeder by Feeder basis (i) the vendor photo and the assets identified within the photo to (ii) the assets identified with the NG Smallworld GIS system and (iii) the assets located on the NG regional control center index maps. The contractor will identify any discrepancies between these three components and either (a) update the NG Smallworld GIS system where appropriate or (b) recommend changes to the NG Smallworld GIS and Index Maps for correction by other NG departments. All updates, recommended changes or questions to external groups shall be entered by the Contractor within the NG IMAP ARCGIS Online environment. Contractor will confirm the photo quality and verify that the photo assigned to a NG GIS Asset ID is consistent with the asset information within NG Smallworld GIS. Discrepancies will require that the Outside Vendor for Photo Acquisition be notified to enable them to correct the photos.
Contractor execute a series of checks which validate the connectivity of the feeder. Contractor will update the NG Smallworld GIS system as appropriate to correct any validation errors.
Contractor (separate from the contractor who performs the virtual walk down and validation phases) will perform a quality control / quality assurance step on the feeder, ensuring that the proposed modifications are accurate based on the QAQC Status assigned to the Virtual Walk Down person. Corrections to the feeder will be sent back to the person assigned the Virtual Walk Down / Validation steps for corrections. Contractor will prepare and send to the NG Maps & Records Sharepoint site (i) all Index Map changes and (ii) complex changes.
QAQC Contractor resource will close out a feeder by posting the Smallworld GIS modifications within the NG Smallworld GIS system when a feeder has been determined to be clean of any issues / discrepancies.

Manager notes:
- Project's original scope is through March 2021.
- Location: Syracuse NY
- Open to candidates who need to relocate (please indicate this at the top of the resume).
There should not be any additional charge to National Grid for the candidate to relocate.
- Electric distribution experience/knowledge is requested, but not required.
- GIS experience - not a necessity but it does help with the process of using the tools
- When the contractor is reviewing the asset on the poles and comparing it's very helpful
to have knowledge of electrical distribution
-BA degree or equivalent experience
-MA degree is overqualified
- Independent worker is valuable
*More electric distribution experience requested as compared to ARCGIS experience. We can teach the ARCGIS experience, but the electric experience is valuable when a virtual walk down of the electricity distribution system occurs to confirm the connectivity model. The connectivity model is a simple way of indicating that all of the components on the electric distribution system align.*

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
