About Us
Presbyterian Healthcare Services is a locally owned, not-for-profit healthcare system of nine hospitals, a statewide health plan and a growing multi-specialty medical group. Founded in New Mexico in 1908, it is the state's largest private employer with approximately 11,000 employees.
Presbyterian's story is really the story of the remarkable people who have chosen to work here. Starting with Reverend Cooper who began our journey in 1908, the hard work of thousands of physicians, employees, board members, and other volunteers brought Presbyterian from a tiny tuberculosis sanatorium to a statewide healthcare system, serving more than 700,000 New Mexicans.

We are part of New Mexico's history - and committed to its future. That is why we will continue to work just as hard and care just as deeply to serve New Mexico for years to come.

About New Mexico
New Mexico's unique blend of Spanish, Mexican and Native American influences contribute to a culturally rich lifestyle. Add in Albuquerque's International Balloon Fiesta, Los Alamos' nuclear scientists, Roswell's visitors from outer space, and Santa Fe's artists, and you get an eclectic mix of people, places and experiences that make this state great.

Cities in New Mexico are continually ranked among the nation's best places to work and live by Forbes magazine, Kiplinger's Personal Finance, and other corporate and government relocation managers like Worldwide ERC.

New Mexico offers endless recreational opportunities to explore, and enjoy an active lifestyle. Venture off the beaten path, challenge your body in the elements, or open yourself up to the expansive sky. From hiking, golfing and biking to skiing, snowboarding and boating, it's all available among our beautiful wonders of the west.

About Us: At Emendata, we help bridge the gap between data and the real world. We partner with organizations that have a social mission and help them tackle their problems using analytics. Our role in these partnerships goes end to end—we handle everything from wrangling the data to analyzing the problem to turning the results into something actionable. Importantly, we understand that this analytics pipeline does not live in a vacuum. Getting to meaningful numbers requires more than just the right methods; it calls for understanding the people, policies, data, and systems involved. With this approach, our small but fast-growing team is having a big impact, taking on challenges like using analytics to combat fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare.
About the Role: This role leads the way in producing analytics that reflect a deep level of understanding and a high degree of quality. We are looking for you to:

Qualifications: If you do not meet all the criteria below but still think you would be a good fit for this role, please apply so we can see if we can find the right spot for you on the team. We value experience but also welcome aptitude and enthusiasm.

To be considered for this position, applicants must have the ability to work in the U.S. without a need for current or future visa sponsorship.
About the Interview Process: We want both sides to learn what it would be like to work together.

For example, produce recruiting competency factor analysis to improve our hiring process
Bring clarity to overall recruiting funnel and areas that strategically require the most attention

About Panjiva


Panjiva is a data-driven technology company that uses machine learning to extract insights from global trade data. This unstructured data describes the behavior of the many real-world entities such as companies, products, and ports, that make up international trade in goods across borders. Our technology and expertise allow us to extract and link these entities from our database of billions of individual records. This data powers the Panjiva platform, through which we provide powerful search, analysis, and visualization capabilities to our customers.

Recognizing Panjiva's cutting-edge technology, S&P Global's Market Intelligence division acquired Panjiva in 2018.

Collaborate closely with data scientists, engineers, and researchers to improve Panjiva’s data-driven, machine learning technologies and create prototypes of new data tools
Deliver insights through written reports, presentations, and enterprise client interactions

Storyblocks is a different kind of content company delivering a fresh approach to meet the creative needs of a new generation of storytellers. Built on the belief that all stories deserve a chance to be told, Storyblocks provides video, audio, and images through its unique subscription model. By offering unlimited downloads and continually adding fresh content, Storyblocks challenges the paradigm that your ambitious creative vision requires deep pockets. Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, Storyblocks has been recognized by the Inc 5000 list seven consecutive years and was recently named as one of Washington D.C.'s Top Workplaces by The Washington Post, and among the Best Places to Work by the Washington Business Journal.

COVID-19 Update:

Storyblocks has adjusted to the COVID-19 pandemic by creating a flexible, work-from-home environment. All employees are free to work from wherever they like through at least April 2021 (or later depending on vaccine rollouts).

Who You Are:

We're looking for a data analyst to help us deliver business intelligence and insights to every function of the organization! The right candidate will have deep analytical and visualization expertise with experience performing both quick data pulls and deep-dive analyses. If you're excited by the opportunity to get exposure to multiple problem spaces filled with challenging and interesting questions to solve with data, this is a role for you!

What You'll Do:

Thought Partnership

Storyblocks structures its teams using a modified squad (i.e. multi-functional team) model in which our analysts form partnerships with squad leads. As an analyst, that means you will:
work with your squad lead to ask and answer important questions that drive value for our business by improving our understanding of our customers and product
set up reporting to measure your squad's performance while also using your expertise to inform which metrics to track
use data to identify and own high-value problem spaces within your squad's purview
work with your squad lead to drive iterative development, creating experiments to test hypotheses, analyzing the results, and building on the knowledge gained
estimate impact to inform prioritization decisions and tradeoffs
Core Analytics

At Storyblocks, you'll use your analytical prowess to its fullest extent. That means you will:
develop and maintain data-driven reporting and dashboards
extract, clean, transform, and visualize data to inform business decisions
break down and solve difficult problems with data
use both databases and distributed computing technologies to manipulate data
perform statistical analyses to determine significance and help stakeholders make decisions
What You Bring to the Table:
0 - 2 years of hands-on analytics experience manipulating large, complex data sets
Expertise in data manipulation, ideally using at least one of SQL, Python, or R
Experience with data visualization or dashboarding
Experience with executive-level reporting a plus
Ability to make tradeoffs between effort and return, automating tasks when appropriate
Strong analytical and critical thinking skills
Comfort breaking down and attacking open ended problems
Familiarity with A/B Testing and statistical techniques a plus
Team player that can collaborate and communicate with people across all levels and functions
What We Bring to the Table:
Competitive and fair compensation: We believe in fair pay--equal pay for equal work. For each title, we have consistently applied competitive salary bands based on market data and benchmarks. What you've been paid before, fear of conflict, or willingness to negotiate does not play a part.
Company-paid medical: Our medical, dental and vision premiums are covered 100% for you and your dependents.
Paid parental leave: Welcoming new family members is exciting, but it can also be challenging. We offer twelve weeks paid leave for primary caregivers and four weeks for secondary caregivers. We have a dedicated private nursing room available to new mothers.
Unlimited vacation: At Storyblocks we take vacation seriously. That means take the time off when you need it. Don't worry about tracking hours or accounting for partial days. Typically employees take about three or four weeks each year.
Flexible work-from-home options: Much of our workflow is online, and for meetings, we have dedicated video-conferencing setups. As long as you deliver results, you are welcome to get your work done outside of the office or during unusual times when desired.
Company-sponsored mentorship and growth: We have a formal mentorship program that involves regular career and growth conversations. ""360-degree"" feedback is collected twice a year and synthesized into actionable, peer-reviewed, performance reviews. We happily foot the bill for conferences and online courses that will add value to the organization. We encourage attending meetups and are happy to host them as well.
Casual Work Environment: Sure we all get dressed up once in a while, but in general we want you to be comfortable at the office – whatever that means to you (flip-flops, shorts, jeans, etc.).
Fully stocked kitchen: Everyone gets input on the food and drinks we stock in our shared refrigerators and snack room. We have multiple mechanisms for making coffee and cold-brew kegs are often on tap.
Dogs in the office: We love dogs and we will probably love your dog too. With help from a calendar, we allow employees to bring in their dogs to help guide us through the day.

Senior Data Business Systems Analyst,-1,"***Not able to use 3rd Party Agencies***

Senior Data Business Systems Analyst
As a Senior Data BSA/Product Associate on the Transactional Data Products team within the Enterprise Data and Analytics, you will drive the ingestion and integration of core data domains to be leveraged by Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics teams to gain insights on the companies’ successes and opportunities. You will propel analytics through robust data comprehension, requirement mapping, data modeling, and cross-functional partnership. With this diverse role, areas of potential focus range from (1) data architecture design to direct business process evolution, (2) backlog prioritization and management, (3) reverse engineering to understand and evolve an existing solution, (4) researching a critical source system/service to automate ingestion, and (5) educating teammates on your robust knowledge of business data requirements and business process. This role will be vital in shaping the landscape by which analytics teams interact with and leverage data, as each release broadens available data sets and expands analytics self-serve capabilities.

Beyond these core competencies it will be very important for this candidate to be comfortable working with remote data science professionals. This assignment will be working specifically to support the recent Acquisition of Celect and onboarding them to existing data products as well as eliciting requirements to build new ones.
If you’re right for this role, you’re a data evangelist with hands-on SQL experience, agile product experience and a basic understanding of data architecture. In your daily work, you actively seek the most effective path forward, and are insistent on progress. You are equally comfortable working in a relational data store and a “big data” cloud eco-system. To you, the importance of value-based solutioning, incremental progress, and failing fast is clear, and you can demonstrate how each of these helps to drive business results. You enjoy finding relationships between disparate data sets and clarity in a muddied data environment. When it is time to simplify a complex technical idea onto a white board for a non-technical audience, you want the pen in your hand.

Requirements for this position include:
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Information Systems, Business or other relevant areas and/or extensive work experience focused in data management and analysis.
Minimum 5 years of related professional experience required.
Proven ability to perform thorough data analysis and present relevant results.
Proven ability to sift through data, identify critical information, analyze, and develop solution options.
In-depth understanding of the Agile principles and methodologies and how they’re applied in workplace culture.
Be a Product advocate; can describe the Product, its value, how it works, how it is adopted, speak to upcoming changes and tailor the information to the audience.
Work directly with customers and team members to capture details of Feature requirements, understand use cases, collect samples, and find tests; apply knowledge of Product and business drivers to enhance work.
Ability to solve complex problems and take a new perspective on existing solutions.
Self-directed and comfortable working in ambiguous environments.
Strong presentation, written, and verbal communication skills.
Strong technical skillset (SQL, Data Modeling, Business Requirements, Big Data, Amazon Web Services).
Ability to mentor entry-level and intermediate data analysts and drive work within small teams.
Ability to troubleshoot technical and non-technical problems.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Contractor will compare on a Feeder by Feeder basis (i) the vendor photo and the assets identified within the photo to (ii) the assets identified with the NG Smallworld GIS system and (iii) the assets located on the NG regional control center index maps. The contractor will identify any discrepancies between these three components and either (a) update the NG Smallworld GIS system where appropriate or (b) recommend changes to the NG Smallworld GIS and Index Maps for correction by other NG departments. All updates, recommended changes or questions to external groups shall be entered by the Contractor within the NG IMAP ARCGIS Online environment. Contractor will confirm the photo quality and verify that the photo assigned to a NG GIS Asset ID is consistent with the asset information within NG Smallworld GIS. Discrepancies will require that the Outside Vendor for Photo Acquisition be notified to enable them to correct the photos.
Contractor execute a series of checks which validate the connectivity of the feeder. Contractor will update the NG Smallworld GIS system as appropriate to correct any validation errors.
Contractor (separate from the contractor who performs the virtual walk down and validation phases) will perform a quality control / quality assurance step on the feeder, ensuring that the proposed modifications are accurate based on the QAQC Status assigned to the Virtual Walk Down person. Corrections to the feeder will be sent back to the person assigned the Virtual Walk Down / Validation steps for corrections. Contractor will prepare and send to the NG Maps & Records Sharepoint site (i) all Index Map changes and (ii) complex changes.

Manager notes:
- Project's original scope is through March 2021.
- Location: Syracuse NY
- Open to candidates who need to relocate (please indicate this at the top of the resume).
There should not be any additional charge to National Grid for the candidate to relocate.
- Electric distribution experience/knowledge is requested, but not required.
- GIS experience - not a necessity but it does help with the process of using the tools
- When the contractor is reviewing the asset on the poles and comparing it's very helpful
to have knowledge of electrical distribution
-BA degree or equivalent experience
-MA degree is overqualified
- Independent worker is valuable
*More electric distribution experience requested as compared to ARCGIS experience. We can teach the ARCGIS experience, but the electric experience is valuable when a virtual walk down of the electricity distribution system occurs to confirm the connectivity model. The connectivity model is a simple way of indicating that all of the components on the electric distribution system align.*

Candidate will be required to relocate to the Syracuse, NY area.
Candidate shall work remotely with an anticipated need to meet at National Grid’s downtown Syracuse NY facility less than 1 time per week.
At National Grid’s option, Candidate may be required to report to National Grid’s downtown Syracuse NY facility on a daily basis during the initial 2-3 month training period depending upon Candidate’s ability to learn and perform job responsibilities.
National Grid’s COVID-19 response may result in Candidate reporting to National Grid’s downtown Syracuse, NY facility daily on a more permanent basis.
These clarifications should assist in providing additional insight into the work that the contractors would be performing. This also should assist them in targeting candidates more effectively.
1st Modification: Education:
Expand candidate pool to include candidates with AAS degrees in either Electrical Technology or Electrical Power Technology
2nd Modification: Key Tasks, Add the following bulleted items to more accurately detail what would be expected of a contractor performing work on either the NY / NE Data Enhancement Project:
Contractor will compare on a Feeder by Feeder basis (i) the vendor photo and the assets identified within the photo to (ii) the assets identified with the NG Smallworld GIS system and (iii) the assets located on the NG regional control center index maps. The contractor will identify any discrepancies between these three components and either (a) update the NG Smallworld GIS system where appropriate or (b) recommend changes to the NG Smallworld GIS and Index Maps for correction by other NG departments. All updates, recommended changes or questions to external groups shall be entered by the Contractor within the NG IMAP ARCGIS Online environment. Contractor will confirm the photo quality and verify that the photo assigned to a NG GIS Asset ID is consistent with the asset information within NG Smallworld GIS. Discrepancies will require that the Outside Vendor for Photo Acquisition be notified to enable them to correct the photos.
Contractor execute a series of checks which validate the connectivity of the feeder. Contractor will update the NG Smallworld GIS system as appropriate to correct any validation errors.
Contractor (separate from the contractor who performs the virtual walk down and validation phases) will perform a quality control / quality assurance step on the feeder, ensuring that the proposed modifications are accurate based on the QAQC Status assigned to the Virtual Walk Down person. Corrections to the feeder will be sent back to the person assigned the Virtual Walk Down / Validation steps for corrections. Contractor will prepare and send to the NG Maps & Records Sharepoint site (i) all Index Map changes and (ii) complex changes.
QAQC Contractor resource will close out a feeder by posting the Smallworld GIS modifications within the NG Smallworld GIS system when a feeder has been determined to be clean of any issues / discrepancies. The QAQC Contractor will notify the National Grid DP&I department that a feeder is closed, enabling the DP&I department to continuously monitor that feeder for any modifications in the future.
Manager notes:
- Project's original scope is through March 2021.
- Location: Syracuse NY
- Open to candidates who need to relocate (please indicate this at the top of the resume).
There should not be any additional charge to National Grid for the candidate to relocate.
- Electric distribution experience/knowledge is requested, but not required.
- GIS experience - not a necessity but it does help with the process of using the tools
- When the contractor is reviewing the asset on the poles and comparing it's very helpful
to have knowledge of electrical distribution
-BA degree or equivalent experience
-MA degree is overqualified
- Independent worker is valuable
*More electric distribution experience requested as compared to ARCGIS experience. We can teach the ARCGIS experience, but the electric experience is valuable when a virtual walk down of the electricity distribution system occurs to confirm the connectivity model. The connectivity model is a simple way of indicating that all of the components on the electric distribution system align.*

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Business Analyst/Data Scientist Needed for Growing Solar Startup,-1,"“...solar power will be the single largest source of electricity generation… People do not understand the magnitude of the business. It's really very, very significant.”


- Elon Musk

Once a fringe thing hippies did, “going solar” is now going mainstream. It took over 30 years for the first 1 million solar installations to be completed. It only took another 3 years to install the second million. Over the next 2 years another 1 million homes will “go solar” and there are 90 million American households to go after that! Solar technology is cheaper, better and more reliable than ever. Unless your head is buried in a coal mine, it's becoming abundantly clear that solar is the future.

With rapid growth & mainstream adoption comes massive investment and opportunity in the space. Installation companies are growing quickly, making them hungry for even more growth, and solar continues to accelerate even in a post-COVID world. The last thing you want is the power going out during a quarantine and it's also a product that saves people money, enhances family security, and can be sold over the phone. The technology is dialed, the installation process is clean, but it's still a challenge to find customers. Since customers that convert into sales are the lifeblood of any company, sales leads are the raw tool that unleashes massive growth for solar installers.

Finding qualified customers: that's what we do at SolarLeadFactory.

About Us:


SolarLeadFactory has helped nearly 1 million homeowners looking to buy solar. We have helped hundreds of solar installers grow their businesses - and aim to help hundreds more.

Don't be fooled by our name: we're more than just a 'lead-gen company'. Our business is built on a proprietary software platform allowing us to deliver a best in class product and innovate constantly. We have in-house developers, digital marketing experts, and scientists relentlessly driving the product forward.

Our mission: to unlock consumer demand for solar power.

About You:


You're looking for a way to make a huge positive difference in the world & help the companies on the front lines of the solar revolution!

You want to be part of a small but driven team making a big impact on one of the most pressing issues of our time. You share some of our core values including “Making Learning the Key Metric”, “Holding Yourself Accountable”, “Always be Testing Something,” and “Master your Craft”.

Most importantly, you love working with data and applying your expertise to specific business problems.

We believe at some level every business becomes a data science problem, and as a marketplace with tens to hundreds of millions of data points we've got some big meaty problems to chew on.

In order to be successful in this position you must be skilled, highly organized, efficient, proactive, analytical, tech savvy, and an excellent communicator.

Do you want to learn? To grow? To make a difference?

Critical Skills:
Skill and experience with business analysis/data science applied to specific business cases
Proficiency and experience with modern data tools & infrastructure (e.g. Mode, S3/Redshift, Fivetran/Stitch/Segment, dbt)
Proficiency and experience in relevant programming languages for modeling/data visualization (Required: SQL, Highly Valuable: Python, R)
Extremely Desirable: Proficiency and experience with predictive analytics models, statistical modeling, econometrics, complex marketplace analysis, or related fields.
Solar experience is not required, but an interest in solar is
Efficient, fast-moving, doer
Ambition to grow
Problem solving, ability to find solutions, and getting things done
Excellent verbal & written skills
Be tech savvy and comfortable with modern software solutions & platforms
Ability to maintain equanimity in trying situations
Ability to work with a team to find great solutions
Your Mission:


If you're excited by ‘diving into the data' and developing models that drive huge business action, this role is for you. Day to day could include everything from building predictive analytic models to managing the development of our increasingly complex marketplace algorithms.

You will be asked to help pull and prepare data sets as well as use these to answer one-off and ongoing questions about specific business cases (e.g. churn rate of a particular customer type).

You will help us sniff out where the 80/20 impact could be for effective action to grow the company, based on your analysis. And you will help us standardize our data and access to it using the best infrastructure and tools that we can put together.

You will be supported by and work with our entire team, including a small but extremely competent software engineering team, the founders/CEO, and anyone else on our team who gets directly into the data.

What you get out of this:
Competitive salary
Results driven organization
Remote location - work from anywhere on a North American time zone

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Contractor will compare on a Feeder by Feeder basis (i) the vendor photo and the assets identified within the photo to (ii) the assets identified with the NG Smallworld GIS system and (iii) the assets located on the NG regional control center index maps. The contractor will identify any discrepancies between these three components and either (a) update the NG Smallworld GIS system where appropriate or (b) recommend changes to the NG Smallworld GIS and Index Maps for correction by other NG departments. All updates, recommended changes or questions to external groups shall be entered by the Contractor within the NG IMAP ARCGIS Online environment. Contractor will confirm the photo quality and verify that the photo assigned to a NG GIS Asset ID is consistent with the asset information within NG Smallworld GIS. Discrepancies will require that the Outside Vendor for Photo Acquisition be notified to enable them to correct the photos.
Contractor execute a series of checks which validate the connectivity of the feeder. Contractor will update the NG Smallworld GIS system as appropriate to correct any validation errors.
Contractor (separate from the contractor who performs the virtual walk down and validation phases) will perform a quality control / quality assurance step on the feeder, ensuring that the proposed modifications are accurate based on the QAQC Status assigned to the Virtual Walk Down person. Corrections to the feeder will be sent back to the person assigned the Virtual Walk Down / Validation steps for corrections. Contractor will prepare and send to the NG Maps & Records Sharepoint site (i) all Index Map changes and (ii) complex changes.
QAQC Contractor resource will close out a feeder by posting the Smallworld GIS modifications within the NG Smallworld GIS system when a feeder has been determined to be clean of any issues / discrepancies. The QAQC Contractor will notify the National Grid DP&I department that a feeder is closed, enabling the DP&I department to continuously monitor that feeder for any modifications in the future.
Manager notes:
- Project's original scope is through March 2021.
- Location: Syracuse NY
- Open to candidates who need to relocate (please indicate this at the top of the resume).
There should not be any additional charge to National Grid for the candidate to relocate.
- Electric distribution experience/knowledge is requested, but not required.
- GIS experience - not a necessity but it does help with the process of using the tools
- When the contractor is reviewing the asset on the poles and comparing it's very helpful
to have knowledge of electrical distribution
-BA degree or equivalent experience
-MA degree is overqualified
- Independent worker is valuable
*More electric distribution experience requested as compared to ARCGIS experience. We can teach the ARCGIS experience, but the electric experience is valuable when a virtual walk down of the electricity distribution system occurs to confirm the connectivity model. The connectivity model is a simple way of indicating that all of the components on the electric distribution system align.*

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

2nd Modification: Key Tasks, Add the following bulleted items to more accurately detail what would be expected of a contractor performing work on either the NY / NE Data Enhancement Project:
Contractor will compare on a Feeder by Feeder basis (i) the vendor photo and the assets identified within the photo to (ii) the assets identified with the NG Smallworld GIS system and (iii) the assets located on the NG regional control center index maps. The contractor will identify any discrepancies between these three components and either (a) update the NG Smallworld GIS system where appropriate or (b) recommend changes to the NG Smallworld GIS and Index Maps for correction by other NG departments. All updates, recommended changes or questions to external groups shall be entered by the Contractor within the NG IMAP ARCGIS Online environment. Contractor will confirm the photo quality and verify that the photo assigned to a NG GIS Asset ID is consistent with the asset information within NG Smallworld GIS. Discrepancies will require that the Outside Vendor for Photo Acquisition be notified to enable them to correct the photos.
Contractor execute a series of checks which validate the connectivity of the feeder. Contractor will update the NG Smallworld GIS system as appropriate to correct any validation errors.
Contractor (separate from the contractor who performs the virtual walk down and validation phases) will perform a quality control / quality assurance step on the feeder, ensuring that the proposed modifications are accurate based on the QAQC Status assigned to the Virtual Walk Down person.

Manager notes:
- Project's original scope is through March 2021.
- Location: Syracuse NY
- Open to candidates who need to relocate (please indicate this at the top of the resume).

-MA degree is overqualified
- Independent worker is valuable
*More electric distribution experience requested as compared to ARCGIS experience. We can teach the ARCGIS experience, but the electric experience is valuable when a virtual walk down of the electricity distribution system occurs to confirm the connectivity model. The connectivity model is a simple way of indicating that all of the components on the electric distribution system align.*
